# PUSH_SWAP

It's a subjet to practice algorithm, the better way you code you can do less structe to reach the goal

/text
The subject rules
• You have 2 stacks named a and b.
• At the beginning:
◦ The stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers which cannot be duplicated.
◦ The stack b is empty.
• The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a. To do so you have the
following operations at your disposal:
sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
ss : sa and sb at the same time.
pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.
Do nothing if b is empty.
pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.
Do nothing if a is empty.
ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1.
The first element becomes the last one.
rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
rr : ra and rb at the same time.
rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1.
The last element becomes the first one.
rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.


#method that I want to do

1.use merge_sort to sort the list
#about merge_sort I practice the code in https://github.com/weijuan82113/Practice.git

2.transfer the list to binary

3.use Bitwise Operators and radix sort to complete for the O(n) time complexity

4.optimize

# SO_LONG
have to check the map whether there is a path to achieve the goal
so I pratice the code of DFS and BFS algorithm
